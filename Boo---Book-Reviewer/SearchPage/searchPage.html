                  To enter the palace means to walk a path stained in blood...
                  Joseon (Korea), 1758. There are few options available to
                  illegitimate daughters in the capital city, but through hard
                  work and study, eighteen-year-old Hyeon has earned a position
                  as a palace nurse. All she wants is to keep her head down, do
                  a good job, and perhaps finally win her estranged father's
                  approval. But Hyeon is suddenly thrust into the dark and
                  dangerous world of court politics when someone murders four
                  women in a single night, and the prime suspect is Hyeon's
                  closest friend and mentor. Determined to prove her beloved
                  teacher's innocence, Hyeon launches her own secret
                  investigation. In her hunt for the truth, she encounters
                  Eojin, a young police inspector also searching for the killer.
                  When evidence begins to point to the Crown Prince himself as
                  the murderer, Hyeon and Eojin must work together to search the
                  darkest corners of the palace to uncover the deadly secrets
                  behind the bloodshed.
